   From v1.0.0 to v2.9.2.

   - One misnamed tag
   - Removing random utility methods and classes (that weren't private)
   - New entities appearing and considering that to be "features"
   - General effort not to break function signatures -- new arguments
     have default values
   - One version removing methods like =is_py30=, =is_py31=, =is_py32=
     and so on (methods you don't expect the program to use, should
     have been private),
   - v2.6.0 starts supporting bytearrays, structural typing didn't catch it
     -- maybe a bug?
   - non-"exported" entities also considered, leads to large number of "breaking changes"

   44 total, 16 different w/ structural, 14 different w/o structural, (35%)
             13 major changes,           10 major changes

** simplejson

   From v3.0.0 to v3.10.0

   39 versions, 6 different w/ both structural and nonstructural (15%)
   Only 1 misidentified breaking change, authors declared patch releases
   as feature releases

   - entities moved to another module, authors bumped the minor version
     (only breaking change proposal)
   - 3.2.0 -- 3.3.0 was definitely a bugfix, maybe an important one?
   - 3.3.0 -- 3.4.0 changed setup.py a bit
   - 3.6.0 -- 3.7.0 still definitely a bugfix
