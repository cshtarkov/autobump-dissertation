   From v1.0.0 to v2.9.2.

   - One misnamed tag
   - Removing random utility methods and classes (that weren't private)
   - New entities appearing and considering that to be "features"
   - General effort not to break function signatures -- new arguments
     have default values
   - One version removing methods like =is_py30=, =is_py31=, =is_py32=
     and so on (methods you don't expect the program to use, should
     have been private),
   - v2.6.0 starts supporting bytearrays, structural typing didn't catch it
     -- maybe a bug?
   - non-"exported" entities also considered, leads to large number of "breaking changes"

   44 total, 16 different w/ structural, 14 different w/o structural,
             13 major changes,           10 major changes
